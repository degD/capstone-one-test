        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
            I have many hobbies, ranging from farming to fishing, eating to
            cooking, singing to writing, to drawing, to painting, and my
            favourite, just stopping and thinking, imagining. Apart from these,
            I love playing games. I love games! I love computers, as well. I
            really like working with computers. And bugs. Oh, that feeling when
            you found that tiny, disgusting bug. Oh, I love it! I also like
            being with my friends. I like meeting with my friends. I also really
            like having time with my family. Life is beautiful!
